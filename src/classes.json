Topics include the neuroscience of seasoning and spices, the chemistry of browning and carmalization, and the polymer physics of emulsions and meringues. Working in teams of two, students will also research and present to the class on the science of a food preparation technique of their choice, and then design and conduct food lab experiments for us all to taste and learn from.
