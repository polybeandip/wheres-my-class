Thus, this course will introduce us to different frameworks, research, and practices that can help us understand the important role of communication in different, U.S., migration experiences.

We will consider both ways in which communication can function for migrant communities.

In the fifty years since 1972, when the first World Conference on the Environment was held in Stockholm, and the US Clean Water Act was amended, the field of environmental law and policy has become increasingly sophisticated and complex. Regulation of environmental harms has long been a focus of governmental effort. Over the past half century, however, societies have come to recognize that they must adopt controls on pollution to protect the air, ground, water, atmosphere, and the natural world. Environmental law also increasingly touches on energy, agriculture, and land use law, and has expanded to include a focus on corporate law, international trade, environmental governance, environmental justice, sustainable growth and development, and climate change. In this course, we will look at the major statutes and policies used, at both the federal and state levels, to protect humans and the environment against exposure to harmful substances, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, CERLCA (Superfund), Resource Conservation &amp; Recovery Act, Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), and approaches to protecting endangered species and ecosystems. We will also examine the challenges of global atmospheric pollution, including ozone depletion and climate change.

In the fifty years since 1972, when the first World Conference on the Environment was held in Stockholm, and the US Clean Water Act was amended, the field of environmental law and policy has become increasingly sophisticated and complex. Regulation of environmental harms has long been a focus of governmental effort. Over the past half century, however, societies have come to recognize that they must adopt controls on pollution to protect the air, ground, water, atmosphere, and the natural world. Environmental law also increasingly touches on energy, agriculture, and land use law, and has expanded to include a focus on corporate law, international trade, environmental governance, environmental justice, sustainable growth and development, and climate change. In this course, we will look at the major statutes and policies used, at both the federal and state levels, to protect humans and the environment against exposure to harmful substances, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, CERLCA (Superfund), Resource Conservation &amp; Recovery Act, Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), and approaches to protecting endangered species and ecosystems. We will also examine the challenges of global atmospheric pollution, including ozone depletion and climate change. The class will look not only at the substance of these laws and policies, but also review common-law litigation, enforcement challenges, and the role of market mechanisms in addressing environmental issues. Students will become familiar with the history of environmental law and will analyze important landmark cases, as well as the hierarchy of laws, and jurisdictions that shape environmental law and policy. Students will apply their knowledge to real examples, with the goal of developing innovative legal solutions for the critical environmental challenges facing our world today.", "locations": [{"bldg": "Warren Hall", "room": "Warren Hall B25", "type": "LEC", "typeLong": "Lecture", "time": "02:55PM", "days": "TR"}]}, {"code": "ENVS 4500", "title": "Climate Solutions Capstone", "name": "ENVS 4500: Climate Solutions Capstone", "desc": "Interested in working toward solutions to the climate crisis?

By highlighting the non-self-evidence of truths we hold, the medieval past can help us appreciate why we cherish them nonetheless \u2013 or prompt us to re-evaluate them.", "locations": [{"bldg": "Goldwin Smith Hall", "room": "Goldwin Smith Hall 144", "type": "SEM", "typeLong": "Seminar", "time": "02:55PM", "days": "TR"}]}, {"code": "HIST 2151", "title": "War in Experience and Expression: Origins of Modern War-Writing, 1500-1900", "name": "HIST 2151: War in Experience and Expression: Origins of Modern War-Writing, 1500-1900", "desc": "This seminar treats the tension between the compelling moral, historical and psychological imperatives to represent armed conflict and the rhetorical difficulties attendant on doing so.

We will examine ways of mapping this linguistic information both to linguistic theory as well as to measures of human processing (e.g., neuroimaging data and human behavioral responses).", "locations": [{"bldg": "Morrill Hall", "room": "Morrill Hall 110", "type": "LEC", "typeLong": "Lecture", "time": "01:25PM", "days": "MW"}]}, {"code": "LING 4451", "title": "Greek Comparative Grammar", "name": "LING 4451: Greek Comparative Grammar", "desc": "The prehistory and evolution of the sounds and forms of ancient Greek as reconstructed by comparison with the other Indo-European languages.", "locations": [{"bldg": "Goldwin Smith Hall", "room": "Goldwin Smith Hall 122", "type": "LEC", "typeLong": "Lecture", "time": "02:55PM", "days": "MW"}]}, {"code": "LING 4712", "title": "Topics in the Philosophy of Language", "name": "LING 4712: Topics in the Philosophy of Language", "desc": "An investigation of varying topics in the philosophy of language including reference, meaning, the relationship between language and thought, communication, modality, logic and pragmatics.", "locations": [{"bldg": "Uris Hall", "room": "Uris Hall 204", "type": "SEM", "typeLong": "Seminar", "time": "02:00PM", "days": "T"}]}, {"code": "LING 6261", "title": "Introduction to Indo-European Linguistics", "name": "LING 6261: Introduction to Indo-European Linguistics", "desc": "An introduction to the phonology, morphology, and syntax of Proto-Indo-European and the chief historical developments of the daughter languages.", "locations": [{"bldg": "Morrill Hall", "room": "Morrill Hall 102", "type": "LEC", "typeLong": "Lecture", "time": "11:15AM", "days": "MWF"}]}, {"code": "LING 6324", "title": "Cayuga Language and Culture", "name": "LING 6324: Cayuga Language and Culture", "desc": "An introduction to the language and culture of the Cayuga (Gayogo\u0331h\u00f3\ua789n\u01eb\u02bc) people.

Thus, this course will introduce us to different frameworks, research, and practices that can help us understand the important role of communication in different, U.S., migration experiences.

We will also address new ethical questions and controversies that law and policy has yet to sort out. Through this course you'll learn about the key frameworks, processes, and institutions that govern the contemporary world of technology, along with key theories and methods from the academic fields that shape and inform them (law, philosophy, economics, political science, communication, sociology, etc.). You'll also learn core writing and analytic skills central to success in the worlds of social science, law, policy, and many other settings. But above all you'll learn to engage critically and strategically with the worlds of information and technology around you, deciding what kind of information consumer, user, and citizen YOU want to be.\u00a0\u00a0", "locations": [{"bldg": "Statler Hall", "room": "Statler Hall 185-Aud", "type": "LEC", "typeLong": "Lecture", "time": "01:25PM", "days": "MW"}, {"bldg": "Hollister Hall", "room": "Hollister Hall 312", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "10:10AM", "days": "R"}, {"bldg": "Hollister Hall", "room": "Hollister Hall 312", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "11:15AM", "days": "R"}, {"bldg": "Snee Hall Geological Science", "room": "Snee Hall Geological Sci 2154", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "12:20PM", "days": "R"}, {"bldg": "Hollister Hall", "room": "Hollister Hall 368", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "01:25PM", "days": "R"}, {"bldg": "Hollister Hall", "room": "Hollister Hall 368", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "09:05AM", "days": "F"}, {"bldg": "Upson Hall", "room": "Upson Hall 222", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "10:10AM", "days": "F"}, {"bldg": "Upson Hall", "room": "Upson Hall 222", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "11:15AM", "days": "F"}, {"bldg": "Hollister Hall", "room": "Hollister Hall 401", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "11:15AM", "days": "F"}, {"bldg": "Hollister Hall", "room": "Hollister Hall 401", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "12:20PM", "days": "F"}, {"bldg": "Phillips Hall", "room": "Phillips Hall 213", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "12:20PM", "days": "F"}, {"bldg": "Phillips Hall", "room": "Phillips Hall 213", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "01:25PM", "days": "F"}, {"bldg": "Statler Hall", "room": "Statler Hall 291", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "09:05AM", "days": "R"}]}, {"code": "STS 2051", "title": "Ethical Issues in Health and Medicine", "name": "STS 2051: Ethical Issues in Health and Medicine", "desc": "In the rapidly changing world of healthcare, complex ethical issues arise from interpersonal interactions between patients and clinicians to broad controversies that propel medicine into headline news.
