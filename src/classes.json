Thus, this course will introduce us to different frameworks, research, and practices that can help us understand the important role of communication in different, U.S., migration experiences. On the one hand, communication can help mitigate some of the social and structural barriers that migrants face in the United States and elsewhere. On the other hand, communication can also exacerbate or lead to educational, economic, and health inequities among migrants. We will consider both ways in which communication can function for migrant communities. Overall, migration: (1) is a diverse area of research that can incorporate intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, organizational, institutional, cultural, and policy levels of analysis; (2) is studied using a wide range of methodologies; and (3) is affected by a variety of communication channels.

As such, services require a distinctive approach to marketing, both in creation and execution. Most business school marketing courses focus on the manufacturing sector. In this class, you will be exposed to a way of thinking about marketing that is grounded by a service-dominant paradigm. You will learn analytical approaches and gain insights needed to develop and implement service strategies.

Voices usually peripheral to the narrative of American development, from enslaved African mariners to Spanish American nuns, will become central to processes of cultural encounter, labor exploitation, revolutionary upheavals, and state formation that shaped the making and unmaking early America.", "locations": [{"bldg": "Rockefeller Hall", "room": "Rockefeller Hall 122", "type": "LEC", "typeLong": "Lecture", "time": "02:55PM", "days": "TR"}, {"bldg": "Goldwin Smith Hall", "room": "Goldwin Smith Hall 350", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "10:10AM", "days": "F"}, {"bldg": "Uris Hall", "room": "Uris Hall G88", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "11:15AM", "days": "F"}]}, {"code": "HIST 2010", "title": "Atlantic Travelers", "name": "HIST 2010: Atlantic Travelers", "desc": "The objective of this seminar is to introduce students to the subjects of mobility and empires in the early modern Atlantic World.

Jews sometimes used religion to modify gender norms, and gender to modify religious norms. Gender was at play in Jewish negotiation of social class, racial status, ethnic status, and even citizenship. In different societies, Jews used gendered religion, and religious gender, to achieve assimilation, or to protect against it. Judaism also contains a strongly gendered tradition of texts and practices, and this tradition pulls Jewish gender in its own directions. Judaism will therefore serve as a kind of incubator, a framework in which to carefully examine the intersections of gender, religion, sexuality, race, and class.

Originating largely as a radical rejection of both traditional Jewish religious life and the Jews' diaspora in favor of modern nationalism, since 1967 Zionism has witnessed religious-nationalist fervor and a Jewish diaspora increasingly interested in or disinterested with the state of Israel.

In the fifty years since 1972, when the first World Conference on the Environment was held in Stockholm, and the US Clean Water Act was amended, the field of environmental law and policy has become increasingly sophisticated and complex. Regulation of environmental harms has long been a focus of governmental effort. Over the past half century, however, societies have come to recognize that they must adopt controls on pollution to protect the air, ground, water, atmosphere, and the natural world. Environmental law also increasingly touches on energy, agriculture, and land use law, and has expanded to include a focus on corporate law, international trade, environmental governance, environmental justice, sustainable growth and development, and climate change. In this course, we will look at the major statutes and policies used, at both the federal and state levels, to protect humans and the environment against exposure to harmful substances, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, CERLCA (Superfund), Resource Conservation &amp; Recovery Act, Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), and approaches to protecting endangered species and ecosystems. We will also examine the challenges of global atmospheric pollution, including ozone depletion and climate change. The class will look not only at the substance of these laws and policies, but also review common-law litigation, enforcement challenges, and the role of market mechanisms in addressing environmental issues. Students will become familiar with the history of environmental law and will analyze important landmark cases, as well as the hierarchy of laws, and jurisdictions that shape environmental law and policy.

It covers different cases and obliges jurists to answer to difficult questions, such as if it is right that a party to a contract tainted by illegality not be able to recover from the other party the money initially paid under the contract or to what extent illegal conduct may deprive a claimant of its rights. The topic assumes primary importance because from the twentieth century onwards the statutes that include prohibitions have been multiplied, for instance to protect collective values, the environment, health, and so on.

Thus, this course will introduce us to different frameworks, research, and practices that can help us understand the important role of communication in different, U.S., migration experiences. On the one hand, communication can help mitigate some of the social and structural barriers that migrants face in the United States and elsewhere. On the other hand, communication can also exacerbate or lead to educational, economic, and health inequities among migrants. We will consider both ways in which communication can function for migrant communities. Overall, migration: (1) is a diverse area of research that can incorporate intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, organizational, institutional, cultural, and policy levels of analysis; (2) is studied using a wide range of methodologies; and (3) is affected by a variety of communication channels.

The Protestant Reformation in particular targeted images as the enemy to a true religion of the Word. Legislation in England determined the wholesale destruction of religious images (iconoclasm) between 1538 and 1644.

As a minority culture for most of its history and in most of its geographical areas, Judaism interacted with gender formation in the majority culture in a number of surprising ways. Jews sometimes used religion to modify gender norms, and gender to modify religious norms. Gender was at play in Jewish negotiation of social class, racial status, ethnic status, and even citizenship. In different societies, Jews used gendered religion, and religious gender, to achieve assimilation, or to protect against it. Judaism also contains a strongly gendered tradition of texts and practices, and this tradition pulls Jewish gender in its own directions. Judaism will therefore serve as a kind of incubator, a framework in which to carefully examine the intersections of gender, religion, sexuality, race, and class.

Through this course you'll learn about the key frameworks, processes, and institutions that govern the contemporary world of technology, along with key theories and methods from the academic fields that shape and inform them (law, philosophy, economics, political science, communication, sociology, etc.). You'll also learn core writing and analytic skills central to success in the worlds of social science, law, policy, and many other settings. But above all you'll learn to engage critically and strategically with the worlds of information and technology around you, deciding what kind of information consumer, user, and citizen YOU want to be.\u00a0\u00a0", "locations": [{"bldg": "Statler Hall", "room": "Statler Hall 185-Aud", "type": "LEC", "typeLong": "Lecture", "time": "01:25PM", "days": "MW"}, {"bldg": "Hollister Hall", "room": "Hollister Hall 401", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "10:10AM", "days": "R"}, {"bldg": "Hollister Hall", "room": "Hollister Hall 401", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "11:15AM", "days": "R"}, {"bldg": "Phillips Hall", "room": "Phillips Hall 307", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "12:20PM", "days": "R"}, {"bldg": "Snee Hall Geological Science", "room": "Snee Hall Geological Sci 1150", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "01:25PM", "days": "R"}, {"bldg": "Phillips Hall", "room": "Phillips Hall 407", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "09:05AM", "days": "F"}, {"bldg": "Hollister Hall", "room": "Hollister Hall 368", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "10:10AM", "days": "F"}, {"bldg": "Phillips Hall", "room": "Phillips Hall 307", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "11:15AM", "days": "F"}, {"bldg": "Hollister Hall", "room": "Hollister Hall 314", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "11:15AM", "days": "F"}, {"bldg": "Phillips Hall", "room": "Phillips Hall 307", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "12:20PM", "days": "F"}, {"bldg": "Snee Hall Geological Science", "room": "Snee Hall Geological Sci 1150", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "12:20PM", "days": "F"}, {"bldg": "Upson Hall", "room": "Upson Hall 222", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "01:25PM", "days": "F"}, {"bldg": "Phillips Hall", "room": "Phillips Hall 213", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "09:05AM", "days": "R"}]}, {"code": "STS 2051", "title": "Ethical Issues in Health and Medicine", "name": "STS 2051: Ethical Issues in Health and Medicine", "desc": "In the rapidly changing world of healthcare, complex ethical issues arise from interpersonal interactions between patients and clinicians to broad controversies that propel medicine into headline news.
