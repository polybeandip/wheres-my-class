Most people have much to \"unlearn\" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations.

We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine, or hospital medicine,\u00a0will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world. In class, our discussions will return regularly to consider the broad diversity of kinds of medicine throughout the world, as well as the specific historical and local contexts of biomedicine.", "locations": [{"bldg": "McGraw Hall", "room": "Mcgraw Hall 165", "type": "LEC", "typeLong": "Lecture", "time": "10:10AM", "days": "TR"}, {"bldg": "McGraw Hall", "room": "McGraw Hall B65", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "08:00AM", "days": "R"}, {"bldg": "McGraw Hall", "room": "McGraw Hall B65", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "09:05AM", "days": "R"}, {"bldg": "Uris Hall", "room": "Uris Hall G22", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "12:20PM", "days": "W"}, {"bldg": "McGraw Hall", "room": "McGraw Hall 366", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "10:10AM", "days": "W"}, {"bldg": "Malott Hall", "room": "Malott Hall 224", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "12:20PM", "days": "W"}, {"bldg": "McGraw Hall", "room": "McGraw Hall B65", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "12:20PM", "days": "R"}, {"bldg": "McGraw Hall", "room": "McGraw Hall B65", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "01:25PM", "days": "R"}, {"bldg": "McGraw Hall", "room": "McGraw Hall B65", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "03:35PM", "days": "R"}]}, {"code": "ANTHR 2505", "title": "Culture, Communities, and Development: From Upstate New York to Quito, Ecuador", "name": "ANTHR 2505: Culture, Communities, and Development: From Upstate New York to Quito, Ecuador", "desc": "This collaborative online international learning and community-based global learning course invites Cornell students to explore the complexities of culture and community and their impact on development, with students and faculty from Universidad San Francisco de Quito, and community partners in Upstate New York and Quito.

We will also examine forms of agency and action taken by women in the face of these larger systems.", "locations": [{"bldg": "White Hall", "room": "White Hall 106", "type": "LEC", "typeLong": "Lecture", "time": "01:25PM", "days": "TR"}, {"bldg": "Rockefeller Hall", "room": "Rockefeller Hall 132", "type": "DIS", "typeLong": "Discussion", "time": "01:25PM", "days": "W"}]}, {"code": "FGSS 2023", "title": "Fighting for Our Lives: Black Women's Reproductive Health and Activism in Historical Perspective", "name": "FGSS 2023: Fighting for Our Lives: Black Women's Reproductive Health and Activism in Historical Perspective", "desc": "This course centers Black women who have often described their reproductive health experiences as \"fighting for our lives.\" While grounded in an exploration of Black women 's experiences in the US, this course also looks across the diaspora to issues of access, rights, and equity in reproductive health.

If you are to be effective, both with respect to the goals of an organization and with respect to your personal goals, you need to be able to map these differences, understand various groups' interests and objective, and understand how to operate in an organizational environment. In addition to being able to think strategically, you also need a set of skills that can be summarized via the words \"power, persuasion, and influence.\" Building on the micro foundations of persuasion tactics, this course will expand students' ability to successfully navigate the social and cultural organizational landscapes in order to be effective agents of change.", "locations": [{"bldg": "Ives Hall", "room": "Ives Hall 116", "type": "LEC", "typeLong": "Lecture", "time": "10:10AM", "days": "MW"}]}, {"code": "ILROB 5285", "title": "Understanding and Improving Decision Making", "name": "ILROB 5285: Understanding and Improving Decision Making", "desc": "Our lives are built upon countless decisions, some small (What am I going to wear to work?) and some very consequential (Should I accept this job offer?).

One is knowledge-oriented: students learn frameworks and concepts for analyzing conflict. Students acquire terms and models for identifying the type of conflict that exists in a situation and the potential costs and benefits of different strategies and tactics. Based on this, students should be able to interpret situations, plan tactics, and recognize and react to their counterpart's behavior. A second and complementary route to improving as a negotiator is practice-oriented: students complement their analytical tools with behavioral skills. Negotiation and conflict ultimately come down to behaviors\u2014how a manager opens a potentially volatile conversation, how a mediator uncovers information, how a negotiator frames an offer or a concession. Practicing these behaviors, and understanding how other parties perceive and react to them, is essential to improving as a negotiator. The course provides continuing opportunities for hands-on practice and also provides feedback, discussion, and occasions for reflection. Through role-play exercises, lecture, reading, and discussion, the course begins with basic dynamics in negotiation and adds complexity in stages, including multiple issues, multiple parties, mediation, agents, and coalitions. Some exercises involve numerical analyses, others revolve around qualitative conflicts. By the end of the course, students should be able to comfortably and confidently approach most any conflict or negotiation: analyzing its nature, understanding their own objectives, and plotting an approach that will give them the best shot at achieving their goals.", "locations": [{"bldg": "Ives Hall", "room": "Ives Hall 109", "type": "LEC", "typeLong": "Lecture", "time": "11:15AM", "days": "W"}, {"bldg": "Ives Hall", "room": "Ives Hall 109", "type": "LEC", "typeLong": "Lecture", "time": "02:00PM", "days": "W"}]}, {"code": "ILROB 6225", "title": "The Impact of Culture and Diversity in Professional Sports Organizations", "name": "ILROB 6225: The Impact of Culture and Diversity in Professional Sports Organizations", "desc": "This course focuses on making the business case, or not, for diversity, equity and inclusion (\"DEI\"), within the major professional sports organizations, (i.e., the National Football League (\"NFL\"), National Basketball Association (\"NBA\"), Major League Baseball (\"MLB\"), National Hockey League (\"NHL\") and Major League Soccer (\"MLS\").", "locations": [{"bldg": "Phillips Hall", "room": "Phillips Hall 307", "type": "LEC", "typeLong": "Lecture", "time": "10:10AM", "days": "TR"}]}, {"code": "ILROB 7235", "title": "Data Analysis in Practice", "name": "ILROB 7235: Data Analysis in Practice", "desc": "The goal of this course is to expose students to common data analysis methods used in social science research.

Geographically, the course traces the transmission of scientific knowledge in ancient Babylonia, Iran, Egypt, Israel, Turkey, and beyond. As such, the course offers students a tour of different ancient civilizations and corpora. Students read selections from cuneiform Akkadian tablets, Egyptian Christian Coptic spellbooks, rabbinic sources such as the Talmud, among many other works. At the same time, students will be required to critically engage recent scholarship in the history of science and medicine as a way to help frame their analyses of the ancient materials. The course interrogates how ancient civilizations transmitted and received scientific knowledge, as well as the relationship between what we today tend to call science, medicine, magic, and religion.

Throughout the semester students perform close readings of a wide selection of Jewish texts from the Bible, Talmud, kabbalah (mysticism), philosophy, liturgy, and modern Jewish thought. In what ways are these various traditions of Judaism interrelated and/or in tension with one another? In the face of the Jewish history's tremendous diversity, what is it that has unified Judaism and the Jewish people over the centuries? By exploring these types of questions, this course examines the appropriateness of defining Judaism as a religion, an ethnicity, a civilization, and/or a culture.

This is a fundamental problem arising in almost every business application where real-time decisions are based on the information revealed thus far. The uncertainty in the problem can be modeled in a number of ways (e.g., a probability distribution over some parameters or an uncertainty set for some variables) and the selection of an appropriate framework is purely a choice of the decision-maker. Such a selection depends on various considerations ranging from the availability of historical data to the tractability of the resulting optimization problem and the robustness of resulting solutions. In the first part of the class, we primarily focus on robust optimization which is a widely used paradigm to handle adversarial models of uncertainty.

Common firm types include partnerships, sole proprietorships, non-profits, mutuals, and publicly traded corporations, among others. This course focuses on one important firm type: the modern publicly traded, privately owned corporation. The course uses economic and statistical analysis to study the interaction of the public corporation, the market, and the law, and how those interactions affect the welfare of managers, shareholders and consumers. The costs and benefits of that standard corporate form of organization are examined. A variety of legal institutions, some of which have evolved over decades, are analyzed. Those institutions define and govern the corporation. They include limited liability, fiduciary duties, the business judgment rule, and shareholder voting. The mechanisms of corporate governance, i.e., those legal and market-based forces that help control the corporation and ensure that managers operate it in shareholders' interest, are examined. Corporate governance mechanisms include hostile takeovers, insider trading, outside directors on the board, the monitoring role of institutional investors, audits, and executive compensation plans. State corporate law and anti-takeover devices are also discussed. The role and impact of federal policies, such as the 1933-34 Exchange Acts, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act in affecting corporate structure and managerial behavior will be an important focus.
